//so now we've gone over a lot of the syntax, but we haven't actually used them in an async function, 
//which is really why they exist. So let's see how that looks:

//let's mock an async event with a timeout

var data = {
	nation:"Belgium"
}

let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject)=>{
	setTimeout(()=>{
		resolve({
			data: {
				nation: "Zamunda",
				crownPrince: "Akeem"
			}
		});
	}, 1000);

});

console.log(data.crownPrince);

//i've tried to use the data in a synchronous fashion, but the crown prince is undefined! (run the code to see) Oh no, let's fix that. 
//use the promise to console log the crown prince (don't actually modify the promise variable itself, use then() to
//extract the data
